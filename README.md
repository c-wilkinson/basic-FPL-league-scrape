# basic-FPL-league-scrape
Very basic scripts to scrape some information from the FPL website.  Each script is in a folder by language, so you know which to use depending on what you'd like to do.  I've done this for a bit of fun, I doubt I'll keep all of the languages up to date.

Do with this as you wish.  

Currently written to login to FPL website via passed in credentials then to navigate to a league and scrape all of the team data from the teams in all pages of the league.  With a global league, or even a generally large league, this will take some time and may not produce a particularly useful chart.
