# basic-FPL-league-scrape
Very basic powershell script to scrape some information from the FPL website.

Do with this as you wish.  

Currently written to login to FPL website via passed in credentials then to navigate to a league and scrape all of the team data from the teams on the first page of the league.  My mini-league is a single page, so didn't see the point in coding it (right now) to go over multiple pages.  The data is then used to create a line chart, charting the positions of each team in the league over time.
