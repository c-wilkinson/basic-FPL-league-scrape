# basic-FPL-league-scrape
Very basic scripts to scrape some information from the FPL website.

Do with this as you wish.  

Currently written to login to FPL website via passed in credentials then to navigate to a league and scrape all of the team data from the teams in all pages of the league.  With a global league, or even a generally large league, this will take some time and may not produce a particularly useful chart.
