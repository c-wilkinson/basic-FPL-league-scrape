# basic-FPL-scrape-scripts
Very basic scripts to scrape some information from the FPL website.  Each script is in a folder by language, so you know which to use depending on what you'd like to do.  I've done this for a bit of fun, I doubt I'll keep all of the languages up to date.

Do with this as you wish.
